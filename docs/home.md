title: Welcome to Read the Docs

## Home for programmers

Reading the docs is a great way to learn. Itâ€™s a great way to learn about a new technology, or a new programming language, or a new framework. We have designed this website so that you can develop the habit to read from the docs. In future, our attempt is to provide you guide with all videos so that you can learn directly from docs and get all information in one place. No need to **make notes** or **write down** anything. Just **read the docs**.
